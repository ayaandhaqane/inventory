Inventory Management Dashboard

This project is a simple full-stack inventory management system built for a small business to track product stock. The goal is to demonstrate clean code, logical structure, and thoughtful design rather than heavy features.

Features
- View all products in a clean dashboard
- Add, edit, and delete products
- Visual low-stock alerts for items with quantity below 5
- Stock level analytics using charts
- Basic validation to prevent invalid data entry

Tech Stack
- Frontend: React with TypeScript; Recharts for data visualization; simple CSS or Tailwind for styling
- Backend: Node.js with Express; RESTful API architecture
- Database: PostgreSQL

Why This Stack?
React with TypeScript keeps components predictable and reduces bugs as the project grows. Node.js with Express is lightweight, easy to structure as a REST API, and fits small-to-medium apps. PostgreSQL provides relational integrity and is production-friendly while still straightforward to run locally (local install or Docker).

Installation & Running Locally
1) Clone the repository
2) Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
3) Start the PostgreSQL database (local or Docker) and set env vars
4) Start the backend server
5) Start the frontend application
6) Open the app in your browser

(Exact commands are documented in the respective folders.)

Notes
The project emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and correctness. The structure is designed to be easily extendable for future features.
